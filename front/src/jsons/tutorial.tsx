			},
			{

				Link: "../../../src/data/Coffee_Grinder_(Get-Down).mp4",
				Level: "2",

				Name: "Swipe",
				Link: "../../../src/data/Swipe.mp4",
				Level: "3",
				Description: "(Prerequisites: Very good 2-step) The first power move many breakers learn. Startby learning two-legged swipes, throwing your arms from your"
				+ " dominant side to your nondominant side, and pushing against the floor with your arms and legs until your legs leave the floor in a sort of spinning"
				+ " handstand cartwheel, and they land 90 degrees from where you started. To get full swipes, do this with only your dominant leg." 
				+ " Make sure you land with your hips high above the ground, which will require you to stomp as hard as you can. "
